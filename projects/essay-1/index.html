negative impacts on this country. The negative impact experienced by the country is felt when plate movements occur in
Indonesian territory, causing earthquakes and other geological disasters. However, the positive impact is that Indonesia
gets long-term benefits that can be considered as a country natural asset, thanks to its tectonic and topographical
patterns, namely the existence of mineralization pathways that cause abundant nickel laterite resources which are
scattered in several regions of Indonesia, especially on the island of Sulawesi where if these natural resources are
properly managed they can meet the needs of the community.</p>
<p><img src="https://azizamir.github.io/portfolio/images/essay_1/worldresources.png" alt="pic1">
<strong>Figure 1.</strong> Global distribution of sulphife and laterite nickel deposits (Elias, 2002).</p>
<p>The world’s nickel resources consist of 70% nickel laterite and 30% nickel sulfide with 60% of the world’s nickel
production coming from nickel sulfide and the remaining 40% from nickel laterite production (Riaza et al, 2011).
Indonesia itself has 8% of the world’s nickel reserves, which is based on data from the Geological Agency in 2012,
Indonesia’s nickel laterite resources amounted to 3.398.269.997 tons with a total reserve of 18.723.558 tons. Based on
these data, it can be realized that Indonesia is one of the largest nickel producing countries in the world so that the
nickel laterite resources owned by Indonesia can be categorized as abundant natural resources, and of course, this
should not be wasted. The low utilization of Indonesian nickel laterite resources still can be seen from the very low
selling price of nickel inside the country compared to the export price of nickel abroad. The low utilization of nickel
can also be seen from the unavailability of smelters in several nickel mining areas. In fact, with the availability of
smelters, nickel ore with a grade below 1.7% can be processed so it can increase nickel ore production. Therefore,
Indonesian geoscientists need to improve their understanding of nickel laterite, update their knowledge on efficient
and effective techniques and methods in laterite nickel exploration activities, and understand the management plan as a
form of optimization of natural resources and support for the Indonesian mining industry.</p>
<p>Nickel laterite is a nickel ore deposit formed from the laterization process of ultramafic rock which can be in the
form of peridotite, harzburgite, dunite, and serpentinite or rocks rich in magnesium (Mg) with primary Ni content of
0.2-0.4%. Generally, the source rock of the nickel laterite such as peridotite, harzburgite, and peridotite occurs in
ophiolite complexes, to a lesser extent in komatiites, and mafic-ultramafic intrusion rock layers in cratonic systems
(Brand et al, 1981). The laterization process will produce a concentration of nickel (Ni) and cobalt (Co) with a factor
of 3 to 30 times the nickel and cobalt content in the host rock. The formation of nickel laterite deposits is controlled
by regional and local scale factors, namely climate, topography, tectonics, and the type of source rock and rock
structure (Elias, 2002). The laterization process will be generating a division of zones in the laterite nickel deposits
from top to bottom, namely limonite, saprolite, and bedrock zones. The nickel (Ni) content in the original rock which
was originally 0.28% will increase to 1% Ni as the residual concentration in the limonite zone (Ahmad, 2001). The
formation of laterite nickel can occur in active plate collision zones such as in Indonesia, Philippines, and New
Caledonia wherein these areas the crushed ophiolite segment sheets are extensively exposed and undergo chemical
weathering aggressively due to climatic factors, namely high rainfall and warm temperatures. Under these conditions,
the possibility of supergene enrichment or re-enrichment of primary sediment in the saprolite zone will very likely
occur.</p>

<strong>Figure 3.</strong> Schematic comparison of principal laterite profile types (Elias, 2002)</p>
<p>Nickel laterite exploration in its application is supported by various geoscience data. In the geological exploration
of nickel laterite, geological factors that need to be considered and observed in the field are bedrock factors,
regional tectonic patterns, topography, and geomorphology. Judging from the regional tectonic pattern, laterite nickel
deposits generally develop in two tectonic settings. The first tectonic setting is the accretion plain where the
tectonically active zone is often associated with ocean-continental plate boundaries or collision zones. In this
tectonic setting, a thrust fault occurs which will result in a mechanism for the destruction of the upper plate of
mantle peridotite and associated rocks which will then form an ophiolite rock complex with a large area of exposure on
the surface. This tectonic process affects the type of nickel laterite deposits that are formed. The age of the
ultramafic bedrock and the laterization period ranges from Cretaceous to late Tertiary. This tectonic setting develops
in the active - inactive island arc setting. For example, Sulawesi Island is a location where laterite nickel resources
are well known at several points, namely at Sorowako, Bahodopi, and Pomalaa. When viewed from the geological aspect,
and the tectonic pattern of the region Sorowako, Bahodopi, and Pomalaa, the three regions are part of the eastern
mandala or the Ophiolite Belt of East Sulawesi where the zone is composed of ophiolite segments of the imbricated
oceanic crust and Triassic-Miocene sedimentary rocks. Based on geological data, the three areas are in an ophiolite
complex composed of harzburgite, lherzolite, serpentinite, diabase, dunite, and diorite rocks. The bedrock that exposed
in the area is an important factor to form nickel laterite deposits which will undergo a laterization process for a long
time.</p>
<p><img src="https://azizamir.github.io/portfolio/images/essay_1/celebesgeo.jpg" alt="pic4">
<strong>Figure 4.</strong> Geological terranes and major faults of Sulawesi (White et al, 2017).</p>
<p>The second tectonic setting is the cratonic plain wherein this setting nickel laterite develops in the komatiite and
ultramafic phases of the mafic complex layer at all ages, namely Archean to Paleozoic. In this setting, tectonics tend
to be stable, which allows the laterization process to take place over a long period of time, causing deep weathering
and expansion of laterite nickel deposit formations into cooler or more humid climate zones. When viewed the
topographical factors, the topographic forms that have a gentle slope, which is a zone that is still able to accommodate
laterite nickel deposits because laterite nickel deposits are not disturbed by erosion processes or slope instability.
In addition to geological factors that have come up, there are other factors, namely the presence of rocks with
relatively high temperatures of iron content, slightly acidic air to aid chemical reactions, high rainfall to aid
chemical weathering and remove soluble elements, strong oxidizing environment, and sufficient time for laterite nickel
deposits to accumulate with a good thickness (Ahmad, 2001). Of course, geological exploration activities need support
from geochemical data and satellite imagery. Geochemical data are used to determine the nickel content in minerals in
rocks, according to Ahmad (2001, p. 33), the amount of nickel content in olivine minerals ranges from 0.2 to 0.39%,
much greater than the nickel content in pyroxene and chromite so that it can be used as a reference for exploration.
Satellite imagery data is also used as supporting data for exploration, specifically used in topographic and
geomorphological observations of the exploration area where the satellite image data can determine the topography area
with a low slope steepness as a zoning area for laterite nickel deposits presumption.</p>
<p>Other geoscience data used in nickel laterite exploration is geophysical exploration data. Several geophysical methods
that can be used in the exploration of nickel laterite is Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR), refractive seismic, reflection
seismic, and resistivity. By utilizing the GPR method, areas containing laterite nickel with a certain weathering rate
can be identified which aims to delineate the nickel laterite deposits area so it can reduce the exploration costs and
obtain an optimal subsurface image. Although there are several disadvantages, the application of GPR is more effective
in producing an image from the saprolite zone to the bedrock of nickel laterite deposits (Francke, 2000). The use of the
GPR method with penetration around 65 meters is considered sufficient to provide an overview of nickel laterite deposits
to the source rock zone so it is considered an effective method to be applied for nickel laterite exploration activities.</p>
<p>With a large nickel laterite reserve, nickel laterite exploitation activities will need to be planned properly. The
current average cost in nickel laterite production will be 20% greater than the cost of nickel sulfide production.
However, nickel laterite mining costs are lower than nickel sulfide which is generally mined through underground mining.
The processing of nickel laterite is more expensive than nickel sulfide, but the benefits of laterite nickel mining
activities will be greater than the mining costs (Elias, 2002). Currently, the method used in nickel laterite processing
goes through three main processes, namely boiling to produce ferronickel or matte, caron process, and high-pressure acid
leaching using sulfuric acid. Various attributes can be increasing the success of nickel laterite development, namely
quality, scale, location, and mining infrastructure where these four factors are essential factors in nickel laterite
mining activities and need to be increased by nickel laterite mining industry players to support the Indonesian mining
industry.</p>
<p>Nickel laterite is a metal resource generated from Indonesia’s growing tectonic complexities with the support of its
natural climate and topography. The existence of the ophiolite segment has its own advantages for Indonesia because the
formation of nickel laterite deposits requires a certain period of time. The amount of nickel laterite resources owned
by Indonesia needs to be balanced with adjustments to domestic selling prices and export prices. The price adjustment
can be done by procuring smelter facilities for the purposes of processing and exploiting nickel laterite so that state
profits will increase, as well as the nickel laterite mining business actors. Technological advances have led to an
increasing need for nickel as a raw material for electronic equipment so that to optimize natural resources and support
state industry, an increase in nickel laterite production also needs support by a deep understanding of Indonesian
geoscientists on the genesis of nickel laterite deposits and its relation to Indonesia’s geological setting, the
exploration method applied in the field, and its management in order to achieve economic growth and energy sectors that
go hand in hand to achieve people’s welfare and Indonesia’s energy security.</p>
