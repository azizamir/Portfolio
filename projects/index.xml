      <description>This project is about a bank which has a growing customer base where the majority of customers are depositors with varying size of deposits. Apart from the majority of customers that are depositors, several customers are also borrowers (asset customers). The bank planned to expand the asset customers to earn more through the interest on personal loans by converting the depositors (potential customers) to personal loan customers while retaining them as depositors.</description>

      <description>The Indonesian region, which developed from an active and complex tectonic mechanism, has indirectly positive and negative impacts on this country. The negative impact experienced by the country is felt when plate movements occur in Indonesian territory, causing earthquakes and other geological disasters. However, the positive impact is that Indonesia gets long-term benefits that can be considered as a country natural asset, thanks to its tectonic and topographical patterns, namely the existence of mineralization pathways that cause abundant nickel laterite resources which are scattered in several regions of Indonesia, especially on the island of Sulawesi where if these natural resources are properly managed they can meet the needs of the community.</description>
