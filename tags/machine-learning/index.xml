      <description>This project is my final project submission on Lintasarta DigiSchool 2021 machine learning developer scholarship program. This project is about image classification using a dataset that contains various hands from different races, ages, and genders, posed into rock/paper/scissors and labeled. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was utilized for classifying the image data into the correct class of target data. The data was provided by dicoding.com and then will be extracted and splitted into two folders, train and val, with a ratio of 60:40.</description>

      <description>This project is about a bank which has a growing customer base where the majority of customers are depositors with varying size of deposits. Apart from the majority of customers that are depositors, several customers are also borrowers (asset customers). The bank planned to expand the asset customers to earn more through the interest on personal loans by converting the depositors (potential customers) to personal loan customers while retaining them as depositors.</description>

      <description>In this recent years, digitalization and automation have been massively transforming and leads global industries to a new era of technology. In line with the technology improvement, there is a high growth of interest in utilizing data to extract an insight that hopes will be an advantage for the industries to reach their objectives. This positive phenomenon also applies in the petroleum industry by utilizing machine learning to aid exploration activities, commercial decision making, and analyze past data to extract unseen data.</description>
